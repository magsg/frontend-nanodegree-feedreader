# Feed Reader Project

### What is Feed Reader?

Feed reader is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. You have 4 categories to choose from: Udacity Blog, CSS tricks, HTML5 Rocks and Linear Digressions.

### How to run the application

* open `index.html` in your chosen browser
* click on the hamburger menu to see the categories
* choose a category and browse through the feeds


### Testing side of the project

The main purpose of the project was to learn how to use **_Jasmine_** to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. The `feedreader.js` file contains a test suite that ensures all the features of the application run correctly and that future development doesn't break them.
